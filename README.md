*Quick Train Schedule is a mod designed to make the setting up of trains as convenient as possible.*

## Features

**Easy Refueling**

You can now set a train station as a refuel station, select the number of locomotives and wagons your train has and click "Fuel." The station will receive a new name, and empty locomotives will automatically drive to this location for refueling.

**Station Names**

With Quick Train Schedule, naming train stations is a breeze. Simply select an item, liquid, or signal in the GUI located to the right of the train station GUI, and then click on one of three options: "Simple Name", "Production" or "Eduction". The station will then receive a new name based on the item you chose.

**Train Schedule**

Creating a train schedule is just as easy. Select "Simple Name" "Production" or "Eduction" and an item, liquid or signal in the GUI to automatically setup the train schedule. Your train will now cycle between production and eduction stations for the selected item.

*Try Quick Train Schedule now and see how much faster and easier managing your Factorio train system can be!*
