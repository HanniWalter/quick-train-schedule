# Quick-Train-Schedule

BETA: Please note that this mod is currently in the first testing phase.

Quick Train Schedule is a mod designed to make creating custom train schedules in Factorio easier and faster.

## The mod offers the following basic features:

### Fast Station Names

With Quick Train Schedule, naming train stations is a breeze. Simply select an item, liquid, or signal in the new GUI located to the left of the train station GUI, and then click on one of three options: "Simple Name," "Production," or "Eduction." The station will then receive a new name based on the item you chose.

### Fast Train Schedule

Creating a train schedule is just as easy with Quick Train Schedule. Once again, select an item, liquid, or signal in the new GUI, confirm your choice, and the train schedule will automatically change. Your train will now cycle between production and eduction stations for the selected item.

### Easy Refueling

Finally, editing your refueling train station is simplified with Quick Train Schedule. Simply select the number of locomotives and wagons your train has and click "Fuel." The station will receive a new name, and nearly empty locomotives will automatically drive to this location for refueling.

Give Quick Train Schedule a try and see how much faster and easier managing your Factorio train system can be!
